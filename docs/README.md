Chronos DB gives every AI agent its own **world**: a copy-on-write branch of the whole database, made in about 2 microseconds. Agents change their world freely; you look at what changed and keep what works.

**Fork, experiment, diff, merge.**

```sql
-- psql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/main
create world agent_7 with (owner = 'claude');
switch world agent_7;
update prices set amount = amount * 0.9 where sku like 'SUMMER-%';
diff world agent_7;              -- what the agent changed, row by row
merge world agent_7 dry run;     -- what a merge would do, and any conflicts
merge world agent_7;             -- or: drop world agent_7
```

It speaks the Postgres protocol, so `psql`, drivers and ORMs connect as they do to Postgres, and it searches filters, text and vectors inside every world.

## Start here

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md): install, the shell, TypeScript, Python, Claude Code, Rust.
- [Concepts](concepts.md): worlds, merging and conflicts, time travel, durability.

## Guides

- [Agent sandbox](guides/agent-sandbox.md): give several agents their own worlds, compare them, merge the best.
- [Agent evaluation](guides/agent-evaluation.md): grade an agent by diffing its world against the expected state.
- [Scenario planning](guides/scenario-planning.md): simulate a thousand futures, score them in SQL, merge one.
- [Merge policies](guides/merge-policies.md): let agents merge on their own within rules you set; review only what breaks them.

## Reference

- [SQL](sql.md): what SQL works now and what doesn't yet.
- [Worlds](reference/worlds.md): every world statement: fork, diff, merge, time travel, undo, simulate.
- [Search](search.md): filters, full text, vectors, fusion.
- [HTTP API](http-api.md), [MCP](reference/mcp.md), [Clients](reference/clients.md), [CLI and settings](reference/cli.md), [Errors](reference/errors.md).

## Running it

- [Postgres compatibility](postgres-compatibility.md): tested drivers and ORMs, protocol features, known gaps.
- [Security and auth](security.md): tokens, agents, safe mode, limits, and what not to expose yet.
- [Operations](operations.md): the folder, checkpoints, crashes, cloud storage, backups, memory.
- [Benchmarks](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md): every result with its method, losses included.
