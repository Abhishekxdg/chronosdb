title: Let agents merge on their own, within rules
---

Reviewing every agent's diff works for ten changes a day. It breaks at ten thousand, especially when the data keeps changing under both the agents and the reviewer. A **merge policy** changes what a person approves: you approve the *rules* once, and review only the merges that break them.

- A merge that keeps to its agent's rules goes through on its own.
- A merge that breaks any rule is refused, with the reasons. Its world stays, queued in `SHOW REVIEWS`, until a person merges it or drops it.

You'll set up a shop, write a policy, give it to an agent, watch a small fix merge on its own while a bulk change and a refund wait for you, then approve one and reject the other. It all runs in `psql` in a few minutes. The whole script is [examples/guides/merge-policies.sql](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/blob/main/examples/guides/merge-policies.sql).

## How it works

```
agent: MERGE WORLD w
   │
   ├─ its rights: may it merge w at all? (merge_own / merge, write_main for main) ── no ──> refused
   │
   └─ inside the merge, holding its locks, on the exact rows it's about to apply:
        does the agent keep to a merge policy?
          no  ───────────────────────────────────────────────> merged
          yes: every rule kept? ── yes ──────────────────────> merged
                                └─ no ──> refused (42501, the rules broken),
                                          the world stays, queued in SHOW REVIEWS
                                             │
                                  a person: DIFF, then MERGE WORLD w  (approve)
                                                   or DROP WORLD w    (reject)
```

Three things make this safe while data keeps changing:

- **What's checked is what merges.** The rules run inside the merge, while it holds its locks, on the rows it's about to apply. Nothing written a moment before or after can slip past the check, and there's no gap between "checked" and "merged" for a race to use.
- **Stale work doesn't win.** If `main` changed a row after the agent forked, a merge that would overwrite it (`USING OURS`, or rows picked by hand) needs a person, unless the policy allows `overwrite`. Without `USING OURS`, those rows are conflicts and the merge fails anyway.
- **The queue says when it's out of date.** `SHOW REVIEWS` records the world's version when the agent asked. `changed_since` is true if the agent kept writing afterwards, or part of the world was merged since, so you know the diff you're about to approve isn't the one that was refused.

A policy only ever takes rights away: an agent needs `merge_own` or `merge` to merge at all, and a policy decides which of those merges need a person. An agent keeping to a policy changes `main` **only by merging**: its `write_main` right lets its merges reach `main`, but a direct `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `put` or restore on `main` is refused, since it would skip the rules. So are `UNDO MERGE` and `UNDO AGENT`, which write their rows straight into a world. People, and agents without a policy, act as their rights alone decide.

## Setup

Start a server on a new folder and connect to it:

```bash
chronos serve shopdb                          # HTTP on 7070, Postgres protocol on 5433
psql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/main
```

Or run the whole guide at once:

```bash
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f examples/guides/merge-policies.sql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/main
```

Make the shop:

```sql
create table orders (id int primary key, customer text not null, status text not null, total numeric(10, 2));
create table payments (id int primary key, order_id int not null, amount numeric(10, 2) not null);
insert into orders values
  (1, 'ada', 'new', 20.00), (2, 'bo', 'new', 35.50), (3, 'cy', 'paid', 12.00),
  (4, 'di', 'paid', 99.00), (5, 'ed', 'new', 8.25), (6, 'flo', 'shipped', 41.00);
insert into payments values (1, 3, 12.00), (2, 4, 99.00);
```

## 1. Write the rules

Small changes to orders may merge on their own. Bulk changes, deletes and anything touching money wait for you:

```sql
create merge policy careful with (max_rows = 3, max_deletes = 0, review_tables = 'payments');
show merge policies;
```

```
  name   | max_rows | max_deletes | tables | review_tables | schema | overwrite | critical | check_reads |          created
---------+----------+-------------+--------+---------------+--------+-----------+----------+-------------+---------------------------
 careful |        3 |           0 |        | payments      | f      | f         | f        | f           | 2026-09-27 16:19:35.06+00
```

Every rule is optional. A rule left out doesn't limit anything, except `schema` and `overwrite`, which are `false` (the safe side) until you allow them:

| Rule | A merge needs a person when | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `max_rows` | it changes more rows than this | no limit |
| `max_deletes` | it deletes more rows than this; `0` means any delete | no limit |
| `tables` | it changes a table not in this list (`'orders,items'`) | any table |
| `review_tables` | it changes any table in this list | none |
| `schema` | `false` and it changes a table itself (`CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP TABLE`), a view, function, sequence, schema or type (or a registered reader, or a critical mark) | `false` |
| `overwrite` | `false` and it overwrites rows its parent changed since the fork | `false` |
| `critical` | `false` and it changes a column a reader marked critical reads (`MARK READER billing CRITICAL`) | `false` |
| `check_reads` | `true` and it read rows that changed in its parent since the fork (its agent decided on state that's gone) | `false` |

Rows are counted as the merge would apply them: one per row it inserts, updates or deletes in the parent, after `ONLY TABLES` / `ONLY KEYS`. A row settled `USING THEIRS` (the parent's value kept) changes nothing, so it doesn't count. Table names are read as SQL reads them: `orders` is folded to lowercase, and `"Orders"`, quoted, is another table (`tables = 'orders,"Orders"'`). The database's own bookkeeping (indexes, constraint rows, `serial` counters) doesn't count. Rows combined `BY COLUMNS` never count as overwrites: they keep the parent's changed columns.

## 2. Give them to an agent

```sql
create agent bot with (can = 'read,fork,write_own,write_main,merge_own', policy = 'careful');
```

`merge_own` lets `bot` merge the worlds it forks, and `write_main` lets those merges reach `main`. The policy decides which of those merges need you. The `token` column is the agent's password, shown only now. The agent connects with it as its user:

```bash
psql "postgres://bot:<token>@127.0.0.1:5433/main"
```

(The script does this with `\gset` and `\connect`.)

## 3. As the agent: a small fix merges on its own

```sql
create world bot_fix with (task = 'mark paid orders shipped');
switch world bot_fix;
update orders set status = 'shipped' where status = 'paid';   -- 2 rows
switch world main;
merge world bot_fix;
```

```
MERGE 2
```

Two rows, no deletes, no payments: it keeps to every rule, so no person was involved.

## 4. As the agent: a bulk change and a refund wait

```sql
create world bot_bulk with (task = 'archive every order');
switch world bot_bulk;
update orders set status = 'archived';                        -- 6 rows
switch world main;
merge world bot_bulk dry run;
```

The dry run lists every row as usual, and a last `blocked` row says why the merge won't go through, before the agent tries:

```
 table  | id | outcome | detail
--------+----+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 orders | 1  | apply   |
 ...
        |    | blocked | merging bot_bulk needs a person's review (merge policy careful: it changes 6 rows (at most 3)); it's queued (SHOW REVIEWS)
```

```sql
merge world bot_bulk;
```

```
ERROR:  merging bot_bulk needs a person's review (merge policy careful: it changes 6 rows (at most 3)); it's queued (SHOW REVIEWS)
```

The error is SQLSTATE `42501` (over HTTP, `403`). An agent should stop there and tell its person the world's name. Nothing was merged, and `bot_bulk` is still there, untouched.

One row can also need a person, if it's in a table you always review:

```sql
create world bot_refund with (task = 'refund order 4');
switch world bot_refund;
insert into payments values (3, 4, -99.00);
switch world main;
merge world bot_refund;
```

```
ERROR:  merging bot_refund needs a person's review (merge policy careful: it changes payments (always reviewed)); it's queued (SHOW REVIEWS)
```

When a merge breaks several rules, the message lists them all: `it changes 40 rows (at most 3); it deletes 2 rows (at most 0)`.

## 5. As yourself: the queue

```sql
show reviews;
```

```
   world    | owner | policy  |              reasons               |           asked            | version | changed_since
------------+-------+---------+------------------------------------+----------------------------+---------+---------------
 bot_bulk   | bot   | careful | changes 6 rows (at most 3)         | 2026-09-27 16:19:35.137+00 |       1 | f
 bot_refund | bot   | careful | changes payments (always reviewed) | 2026-09-27 16:19:35.141+00 |       1 | f
```

Oldest first. Look at a merge as you would any world, then approve it by merging, or reject it by dropping:

```sql
diff world bot_refund;
merge world bot_refund;      -- approve: you have no policy, so your rights decide
drop world bot_bulk;         -- reject
show reviews;                -- (0 rows)
```

- **Approve what you read:** if `changed_since` is `t`, the agent wrote to the world after it asked, so read the diff again. Over HTTP, `merge` takes the `version` you read and merges only if the world is still at it (`409` otherwise).
- **Approve part of it:** `MERGE WORLD bot_bulk ONLY TABLES (orders)` or `ONLY KEYS ('orders/1', ...)` merges some rows and leaves the world open with the rest.
- **The agent can't skip the queue:** its queue entry is in the world's metadata under a key only the database sets. The agent can't remove it, and can't merge the world until a person does, or until it fits the rules.
- **Who did what:** `SHOW AUDIT FOR AGENT bot` lists the agent's forks, writes and merges. A refused merge shows as `metadata`: that's the world being queued.

## 6. Tune the rules

Rules change without touching the agents that keep to them:

```sql
alter merge policy careful set (max_rows = 100);       -- the named rules change; the rest stay
alter merge policy careful set (max_deletes = null);   -- null: no limit
alter agent bot set (policy = null);                   -- bot's rights alone decide now
drop merge policy careful;                             -- refused while an agent keeps to it
drop merge policy careful cascade;                     -- its agents keep to none from now on, in the same step
```

Only an `admin` creates, changes or drops policies, or gives one to an agent. Any agent may `SHOW MERGE POLICIES` and `SHOW REVIEWS`, so it can see its own rules.

## Recipes

Start strict, then loosen the rules as the queue shows you what the agent actually does.

| Agent | Policy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Support bot fixing typos in tickets | `tables = 'tickets', max_rows = 20, max_deletes = 0` | it can't reach anything else, or delete |
| Pricing agent | `tables = 'prices', max_rows = 200, review_tables = 'prices_history'` | routine repricing flows; history rewrites wait |
| Data-cleaning job | `max_rows = 5000, max_deletes = 50` | big but bounded; a runaway `DELETE` waits |
| Agent near money | `review_tables = 'payments,refunds,payouts'` | every change to money has a person on it |
| Migration assistant | `schema = true, max_deletes = 0, review_tables = 'payments'` | may change tables; deletes and money wait |
| Many agents, one table | leave `overwrite = false` | the agent that forked earlier can't clobber a newer write |

`max_rows = 0` means no row may change, so every merge that changes rows goes to a person.

## From Claude Code and other MCP clients

The same rules apply over MCP. With `chronos mcp shopdb --agent bot`, the agent's `merge` tool goes through or is refused exactly as in SQL. Five tools manage policies:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `merge_policies` | the policies, and which agents keep to each |
| `check_merge_policy` | tries rules on a branch's real changes: would it merge on its own, and if not, why |
| `set_merge_policy` | creates or changes a policy and gives it to agents (needs `admin`) |
| `drop_merge_policy` | removes one (`release_agents` takes it from its agents in the same step) |
| `reviews` | the queue |

Try rules on real work before any agent keeps to them. `rules` changes a named policy's rules for this one check, so you can ask "what if?" without changing anything:

```json
{"name": "check_merge_policy", "arguments": {"branch": "bot_bulk", "name": "careful", "rules": {"max_rows": 10}}}
```

```
bot_bulk's merge would go through on its own under merge policy careful with those changes (...)
```

Then set them:

```json
{"name": "set_merge_policy", "arguments": {"name": "careful", "rules": {"max_rows": 10, "review_tables": ["payments"]}, "agents": ["bot"]}}
```

In MCP's default [safe mode](../reference/mcp.md#safe-mode), an agent can *draft* rules but not apply them. `set_merge_policy` changes nothing and answers with the SQL for you to run:

```
safe mode: a person sets the rules agents' merges keep to. Show them the rules and why, and ask them to run this in `chronos <database folder>` or psql:
alter merge policy 'careful' set (max_rows = 10, review_tables = 'payments');
alter agent 'bot' set (policy = 'careful');
```

So a coding agent can study how your agents work, propose rules, test them with `check_merge_policy`, and hand you the SQL. You stay the one who approves the rules.

## Over HTTP

Policies are SQL, so over HTTP you use the `sql` operation.

```bash
curl -s localhost:7070/v1/sql -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sql": "create merge policy careful with (max_rows = 3, review_tables = '\''payments'\'')"}'
curl -s localhost:7070/v1/alter_agent -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name": "bot", "policy": "careful"}'
```
 Agents take a `policy` field in `create_agent` and `alter_agent` (a name, or `null` for none). An agent's refused `merge` gets `403` with the reasons, and a `dry_run` merge returns them in `blocked`.

## Limits, today

- **Counts, not content:** rules look at which tables change and how many rows, not at values. "Refunds under $50 may merge" isn't a rule yet. Put such tables in `review_tables`, or give the agent a separate world and a stricter policy.
- **One policy per agent.** Give agents that need different rules different policies.
- **A partial approval leaves the entry:** after `MERGE ... ONLY TABLES` of a queued world, it stays in `SHOW REVIEWS` with the rest of its changes, with `changed_since` true (its reasons were for the whole world). The world's version doesn't move, so a client's merge at the version it had still works. Drop the world, or merge the rest, to clear it.
- **Merges into other worlds:** a policy checks every merge its agent runs, into `main` or any world, but only `main` is closed to its direct writes. Other worlds it may write (its own, or any with `write`) it writes directly.
- **One queue entry per world:** a world refused again updates its entry (new reasons, version and time).

For rules about the data a merge leaves, not the change itself ("every lead list keeps a lead", "an order's total is its items' sum"), use [merge checks](merge-checks.md): an agent under a policy whose merge breaks one is queued here too.

## Next steps

- [SQL reference: merge policies](../reference/worlds.md#merge-policies), and [MCP: the policy tools](../reference/mcp.md#merge_policies).
- [Concepts: agents](../concepts.md#agents): rights, quotas, the audit trail, undoing an agent's changes.
- [Agent sandbox](agent-sandbox.md): worlds per agent, diffs, conflicts.
