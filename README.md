# Chronos DB

### The database for AI agents: fork the world, try everything, merge what works.

Every agent gets its own copy-on-write **world** (a branch of the whole database) in about **2 microseconds**.<br>
It speaks **Postgres**, searches **filters, text and vectors** in one query, and **merges** changes back with conflicts returned as data.

## Why Chronos DB

Postgres and SQLite were built for **a few long-lived databases with one shared truth**. Agents work differently:

| Agents need to... | Traditional databases | Chronos DB |
|---|---|---|
| Try something without breaking production | Copy the database (seconds to minutes) or mock it | `fork` in ~2 µs, any size, on disk |
| Run many attempts in parallel | One connection pool, one truth, lock contention | Thousands of isolated worlds, 100,000 tested |
| Review what an agent changed | Audit tables you build yourself | `diff` any two worlds or moments, as rows or as SQL |
| Keep the good work, drop the rest | Hand-written migrations | `merge` (whole, by table, by key, by column) or `drop` |
| Undo a bad agent | Restore a backup and lose everyone's work | `UNDO AGENT bot SINCE '-2 hours'`, row by row |
| Search while working | A separate vector DB that can't see uncommitted edits | Filters + full text + vectors inside every world |
| Stay safe with untrusted agents | Roles and hope | Per-agent capabilities, quotas, time and memory limits; humans approve merges |

## How it works

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "main: real state"
    branch agent-1
    checkout main
    branch agent-2
    checkout agent-1
    commit id: "reprice"
    checkout agent-2
    commit id: "restock"
    commit id: "reprice (conflict)"
    checkout main
    merge agent-1 id: "merge: 1 change"
    checkout agent-2
    commit id: "resolve by columns"
    checkout main
    merge agent-2 id: "merge: settled"
```

**Worlds are copy-on-write.** A world is a pointer to an immutable, content-addressed tree of pages. Forking copies the pointer, not the data, so it costs the same ~2 µs at 1,000 rows or 1 million. A world then pays only for what it changes (about 450 bytes on disk for one changed row).

**Merges are three-way and exact.** A merge diffs the world against its fork point, skipping every subtree both sides share, and applies each changed row. If both sides changed the same row, the merge stops and returns the conflicts as data, even when the values happen to match. You then settle them: `USING OURS/THEIRS`, row by row, or `BY COLUMNS` when the two sides touched different columns. Partial merges (`ONLY TABLES`, `ONLY KEYS`) and merges into another world (`INTO`) are logged exactly, so replay after a crash gives the same result.

**Search indexes are shared.** Indexes are built for anchor states and shared by every world forked from them. A world searches the anchor's index minus the keys it changed, plus its changed rows scored directly. That is why a query inside one of 100,000 worlds runs as fast as in `main`.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🌍 Worlds (branches of everything)
- `CREATE / FORK / SWITCH / DROP WORLD`, with JSON metadata, owners and IDs
- Worlds of worlds, to any depth (10,000 deep tested)
- `DIFF` between any two worlds or moments, as rows or as runnable SQL
- `MERGE`: whole, `DRY RUN`, `ONLY TABLES`, `ONLY KEYS`, `INTO` another world, `BY COLUMNS`, per-row `RESOLVE`
- **Time travel:** `SELECT ... AS OF '-1 hour'`, `RESTORE WORLD`, `UNDO MERGE` (30-day retention by default)
- **Undo an agent:** `UNDO AGENT bot SINCE '-2 hours' SKIP CHANGED`
- **Simulations:** `SIMULATE 1000 WORLDS ... RUN $$...$$ SCORE $$...$$ KEEP 10 SEED 42`, deterministic and replayable
- `SHOW STORAGE` per world, `SET TTL`, idle-world sweep, pinned worlds

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### 🐘 Postgres, for real
- Postgres wire protocol: `psql`, drivers, ORMs, prepared statements, `COPY`, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`
- Joins (inner/left/right/full), subqueries, CTEs, `WITH RECURSIVE`, window functions
- Unique, foreign-key (multi-column, cascade) and `CHECK` constraints; `ON CONFLICT` upserts
- Views, materialized views, sequences, enums, temp tables, schemas, `information_schema` / `pg_catalog`
- **PL/pgSQL** functions and triggers, with `EXCEPTION` blocks and `EXECUTE`
- JSONB, arrays, regex, dates/intervals, numeric `to_char`, `SIMILAR TO`
- Transactions, savepoints, `statement_timeout`, `EXPLAIN`
- Checked against real Postgres 17 by a differential test suite (`tests/pgdiff.rs`)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### 🔎 Search, inside every world
- **Vectors:** pgvector-compatible `vector(N)`, `<=>` `<->` `<#>`, `USING hnsw`. Runs [Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)'s pgvector store unchanged
- HNSW graph built in the background, tuned per graph, used only when it proves ≥ 99% recall against exact search; otherwise an exact 1-bit scan with full-precision rescoring
- **Full text:** Postgres `tsvector` / `tsquery`, `ts_rank`, `websearch_to_tsquery`, English Snowball stemmer (identical on 20,000 words), GIN indexes
- **BM25 + typo tolerance + fusion:** `search('table', 'words')`, and `find ... where ... match ...`
- **Geo:** PostGIS points, `ST_DWithin`, exact WGS84 geodesic `ST_Distance`, `USING gist`, nearest-first `<->`
- **Graphs:** recursive traversals driven by indexes (4 hops over 200k edges: 30 ms to 1 ms)

</td>
<td valign="top">

### 🤖 Built for agents
- **MCP server:** `claude mcp add chronos -- chronos mcp mydb`, with `fork`, `diff`, `merge_preview`, `checkpoint`, `rollback` and more
- **Safe by default:** agents change only worlds they forked; a person approves merges (`--allow-merge` to opt out)
- **Agent accounts:** tokens (blake3-hashed), capabilities (`read`, `fork`, `write_own`, `merge_own`, `admin`...), quotas (worlds, changes, writes per minute)
- **Per-agent limits:** `max_query_ms`, `max_concurrent`, `max_memory_mb`
- **Server-wide:** `statement_timeout`, `max_worlds`, `world_idle_ttl`; `serve --safe --admin-token`
- One folder shared by many processes: the first opener serves the rest
- Examples for Claude Code, LLM tool definitions and parallel agents in [`examples/agents`](examples/agents)

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

### 💾 Storage and durability
- Write-ahead log with `fsync` (macOS `F_FULLFSYNC`) on `main` and merges before they return
- Branch writes are fast, and loss is never silent: versions are checked on merge
- LZ4-compressed, content-addressed pages; background checkpoints and garbage collection
- `synchronous_commit = normal | off` when you trade safety for speed
- Page cache with a hard memory cap; databases many times bigger than RAM
- Encryption at rest, backups, and **S3 / R2 / MinIO** storage with a single-writer lease and scale-to-zero (`--features s3`)

</td>
<td valign="top">

### ⚡ Speed
- Scans, hash joins and `GROUP BY` split across every core
- Joins stream: each core joins and groups its part without holding either side whole
- Sorts on every core; `ORDER BY ... LIMIT k` keeps only k rows
- **Spills to disk** past `CHRONOS_WORK_MEM`: `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT` aggregates, `ORDER BY`, grace hash joins, and the writes of a big `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` or `COPY`, which stays one atomic statement
- Packed binary rows, prepared plans cached per schema version
- AVX2 dot products and `POPCNT` 1-bit vector scans
- `SHOW METRICS`: count and p50 / p95 / p99 latency per operation, plus counters

## Quickstart

### Install

A prebuilt binary for macOS or Linux (x86_64 and arm64), checked against the release's SHA-256 sums, into `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
chronos --version
```

`CHRONOS_VERIFY=1` also checks the release's signature with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/).

### Postgres: psql, drivers, ORMs

```bash
chronos serve mydb                              # HTTP on :7070, Postgres on :5433
psql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/main
```

Every world is also a database name: `psql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/agent_7`.

### The shell

```text
$ chronos mydb
chronos:main> put users 1 {"name": "Ada", "role": "admin"}
chronos:main> fork agent-7                       # instant private copy
chronos:agent-7> put users 1 {"name": "Ada L.", "role": "admin"}
chronos:agent-7> diff
1 change on agent-7
~ users/1  name: "Ada" -> "Ada L."
chronos:agent-7> merge
merged 1 change from agent-7 into main; now on main
chronos:main> find users where role = admin match ada
```

### TypeScript and Python (one file each, no dependencies)

```ts
import { Chronos } from "./clients/typescript/chronos";

const db = new Chronos("http://127.0.0.1:7070");
const agent = await db.fork("agent-7");
await agent.put("users", "1", { name: "Ada L.", role: "admin" });
console.log(await agent.diff());
await agent.merge(); // throws ChronosError 409 on conflicts, or if a crash lost writes
```

```python
from chronos import Chronos

agent = Chronos("http://127.0.0.1:7070").fork("agent-7")
agent.put("users", "1", {"name": "Ada L.", "role": "admin"})
agent.merge()
```

### Chronos Studio: a web UI, built in

```bash
chronos studio mydb        # opens the Studio in your browser, on 127.0.0.1 only
```

Worlds as a tree, each table's rows in a fast grid (filters, sorting, any table as of any moment), a row inspector, a SQL console, and the Changes view where you review a world's changes, preview the merge with conflicts explained, and merge into main (or discard, or undo). Edits on main offer to go into a new world first. Agents, the audit log and status are one menu away; ⌘K does the rest. It's in every install, runs beside a running `chronos serve` on the same folder, and a per-run key in the link keeps other pages and programs out. See [docs/studio.md](docs/studio.md), which also covers working on the UI (`npm run dev` in `studio/`).

### Claude Code and other MCP agents

```bash
claude mcp add chronos -- chronos mcp /path/to/mydb
```

The agent can describe, search, query, fork, write, diff and preview merges. **A person merges** unless you pass `--allow-merge` or give an agent account that right.

### Bring your data

```bash
psql postgres://127.0.0.1:5433/main -c "\copy orders from 'orders.csv' csv header"
chronos import mydb orders orders.csv --schema schema.csv    # a Postgres table, schema and all
chronos mydb migrate ./migrations                            # apply numbered .sql files once each
```

## Benchmarks

The full record, with methods, raw tables and every caveat, is in **[BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)**. Highlights:

### Forks and concurrent agents

1,000 agents each fork `main` (100k seed rows), write 1,000 rows and merge back. Same 32-core machine for every system:

| system | fork p50 | merge p50 | total | agent rows/s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Chronos DB** (in memory) | **0.005 ms** | 322 ms¹ | **0.77 s** | **1.29M** |
| **Chronos DB** (on disk, 25 workers) | 0.007 ms | 25–26 ms | 1.4 s | 707k–712k |
| **Chronos DB** (on disk, 64 workers) | 0.008 ms | 64–66 ms | 1.4 s | 713k–716k |
| Dolt 2.3.5 (real `DOLT_MERGE`, 64 workers) | 24 ms | 866 ms | 35 s | 28.3k |
| Postgres 17 (`CREATE DATABASE ... TEMPLATE`, 25 workers) | 2,133 ms | 128 ms | 102 s | 9.8k |
| SQLite (file copy + `EXCEPT` merge) | 2,762 ms | 3,113 ms | 404 s | 2.5k |

Against **Dolt 2.3.5**, the only other database with real merges, at the same 64 workers: **22×** at 10 agents, **20×** at 100 and **16×** at 1,000 before #23 and #29, and **25×** at 1,000 with them.

Postgres 18 clones (`CREATE DATABASE … STRATEGY FILE_COPY` with `file_copy_method = clone`, on XFS or Btrfs, with nothing else connected to the source) and [Xata](https://xata.io/docs/core-concepts/branching)'s open-source copy-on-write branches make copies fast too, but neither diffs or merges an agent's changes back or returns conflicts as rows. We haven't measured either; see [BENCHMARKS.md §1](BENCHMARKS.md#1-forks-and-concurrent-writes-phase-1-kill-gate-10-postgres).

¹ Merges into `main` queue behind each other. On disk with one thread per agent, 1,000 at once, the merge p50 is **714–718 ms, still a loss** to Postgres's 128 ms (it was 1,231 ms before an open world's writes reached the log in batches, #23, and each thread remembered its last world, #29), and fork p50 there rose to 65–73 ms. What's left is the branch map's lock, which forks and merges hold while they log ([§1](BENCHMARKS.md#1-forks-and-concurrent-writes-phase-1-kill-gate-10-postgres), [§8](BENCHMARKS.md#8-the-losses-rerun-on-linux)).

### Vector search on real embeddings

OpenAI embeddings (1,536-d, DBpedia) + 500 queries, top 10, eleven systems each at its defaults, each alone on the same machine. Chronos DB is queried over SQL exactly as Mem0's pgvector store queries it.

| system | 76k: p50 | recall@10 | 1M: p50 | recall@10 | 1M, one user (1%): p50 | recall@10 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Chronos DB** (SQL, pgvector syntax) | **0.72 ms** | **99.98%** | 1.36 ms | 98.6% | **1.16 ms** | **100%** |
| Redis 8.10 | 0.46 ms | 75.0% | 0.50 ms | 74.2% | 11.1 ms | 100% |
| pgvector 0.8.6 | 1.01 ms | 82.0% | 2.40 ms | 92.8% | 30.9 ms | 94.6% |
| Milvus 3.0 | 1.64 ms | 89.2% | 3.92 ms | 97.3% | 3.89 ms | 99.7% |
| Weaviate 1.39 | 1.82 ms | 97.0% | 2.48 ms | 98.2% | 8.47 ms | 100% |
| Chroma 1.5 (embedded) | 1.94 ms | 92.6% | 2.25 ms | 96.8% | 265 ms | 99.7% |
| pgvectorscale 0.9 | 1.95 ms | 97.5% | 8.33 ms | 96.6% | 51.4 ms | 69.8% |
| Elasticsearch 9.5 | 3.24 ms | 90.8% | 3.56 ms | 94.9% | 3.47 ms | 61.3% |
| LanceDB 0.39 (embedded) | 3.30 ms | 85.0% | 3.43 ms | 85.0% | 28.0 ms | 96.7% |
| Qdrant 1.19 | 3.73 ms | 98.8% | 6.67 ms | 99.0% | 5.83 ms | 99.98% |
| OpenSearch 3.8 | 5.12 ms | 96.6% | 10.06 ms | 98.5% | 4.83 ms | 80.6% |

At 1M, Chronos is the fastest of every system that finds more than 75% of the true top 10 (only Redis is faster, at 74%), and the fastest of all for one user; only Qdrant finds more (99.0% against 98.6%, at 6.67 ms). At 76k it has the best recall. Raised to Chronos's 98.6% recall, pgvector takes 13.5 ms against Chronos's 1.36 ms; at the 99.3% recall of Chronos's earlier default beam (`SET hnsw.ef_search = 1000`), Chronos takes 2.30 ms, still ahead of every rival that finds more than 96.8% ([§6](BENCHMARKS.md#6-vector-search-vs-other-vector-databases-on-real-embeddings)).

Synthetic 1M × 384 against **tuned** pgvector (`shared_buffers = 8GB`, prewarmed, `ef_search = 300`, iterative scan):

| filter keeps | Chronos p50 | pgvector p50 | Chronos recall | pgvector recall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| all rows | 0.74 ms | 1.56–1.61 ms | 100% | 91.8% |
| 10% | 1.30 ms | 1.68–1.78 ms | 100% | 91.6% |
| 1% | 0.64 ms | 6.3–6.4 ms | 100% | 88.6% |
| 0.1% | 0.32 ms | 10.1–16.1 ms | 100% | 100% |

### Hybrid search inside a fork (1M rows)

| query | main p50 | main p99 | fork ÷ main |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| filter (1%) | 0.05 ms | 0.09–0.10 ms | 0.91–0.95× |
| text | 0.37 ms | 0.40–0.41 ms | 1.12–1.13× |
| vector + filter (20%) | 0.98–0.99 ms | 1.03–1.04 ms | 1.03–1.05× |
| filter + text + vector | 1.98–2.08 ms | 2.11–2.18 ms | 1.03–1.05× |

Unfiltered vector search in a fork is 1.55× main (2.1 against 1.34 ms), a miss against the 10% target ([§3](BENCHMARKS.md#3-hybrid-search-inside-branches-phase-3-targets-p99--5-ms-at-1m-fork-within-10-of-main)).

### SQL over the Postgres protocol

200,000 rows per table, ms per query. Chronos and DuckDB 1.5 run in process; Postgres 17 runs over local TCP with its default parallel workers:

| query | **Chronos** | Postgres 17 | DuckDB 1.5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `count(*)` | **2.8** | 6.4 | 0.4 |
| `count(*) WHERE amount > 500` | **4.0** | 8.7 | 0.7 |
| `GROUP BY` with `count`, `max` | **9.8** | 19.6 | 4.4 |
| join, then `GROUP BY` with `sum` | **25.3** | 68.6 | 7.5 |
| join `WHERE name LIKE 'user 1%'` | **18.6** | 45.2 | 7.7 |

Over the Postgres protocol at 20,000 rows per table, join + `GROUP BY` takes **4.4 ms** against Postgres 17's 6.9 ms. DuckDB, a column store built for this kind of query, is 2–7× faster than Chronos on these reports.

OLTP at equal durability (`fdatasync` on both): **2,395–2,543 commits/s** against Postgres 17's 2,286–2,320; lookups by key 46–48 µs against 46 µs; key join 52 µs against **50 µs**.

### 100,000 worlds

| worlds | fork p50 | point query main / world | disk per world | memory per world |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1,000 | 1.7 µs | 21 / 14 µs | 551 B | 0.3 KB |
| 10,000 | 1.5 µs | 21 / 21 µs | 557 B | 0.1 KB |
| 100,000 | 1.4 µs | 23 / 21 µs | 564 B | 1.0 KB |

Checkpoint and reopen with 100,000 worlds: 0.87 s and 0.17 s.

### The ultimate test: 300,000 simulated futures, one merge

A real supply chain lives in `main`. **100,000 worlds** each simulate their own reorder policy in SQL (`WITH RECURSIVE` over days of demand), are scored in SQL, and the best 1% fork 100 children each, for three rounds. The winning policy is merged back into `main`: **+32.2% profit** over today's policy, in **4 minutes 40 seconds** on 32 cores (21 minutes on an 8 GB laptop), and the same winner on every run with the same seed, on either machine ([§10](BENCHMARKS.md#10-the-ultimate-test-one-real-state-100000-worlds-a-learning-loop-one-merge)).

Also measured: **Monte Carlo Tree Search** where every tree node is a world (Connect Four, 49,402 worlds, 0.84 ms per iteration, 20–0 against a random player, [§11](BENCHMARKS.md#11-monte-carlo-tree-search-over-worlds)), and a database **25× bigger than its cache**, its page cache held to its 32 MB cap ([§12](BENCHMARKS.md#12-a-database-bigger-than-its-cache)).

### Where Chronos DB loses (today)

| workload | result | why / plan |
|---|---|---|
| Analytics vs **DuckDB 1.5.5** (200k-row reports, 32 threads) | DuckDB **2.2–7× faster** | DuckDB is a columnar OLAP engine; Chronos stores rows. Columnar storage is not planned for v0.1; row counts in the tree and per-page min/max would narrow it |
| Merges on disk, 1,000 agents on one thread each | merge p50 **714–718 ms**, Postgres 128 ms (was 1,231 ms); fork p50 65–73 ms (was 4–5 ms); the run takes 1.8 s against 0.76 s in memory (was 5.0 s) | An open world's writes now reach the log in batches; forks and merges still hold the branch map's lock while they log, which parks the writers. At 25 workers: 1.4 s, merge p50 25–26 ms. See [BENCHMARKS §8](BENCHMARKS.md#8-the-losses-rerun-on-linux) |
| Vector search inside a fork, 1M rows | **1.55×** main, unfiltered; 1.12× text (target: 1.1×) | Probably the fork's changed rows searched separately; not profiled yet |
| Filtered vector search at 10%, 500k × 384 | **1.3×** tuned pgvector (the Phase 1 gate is 5×) | The other filter mixes pass (3.4–47×) |
| Redis vector search (76k and 1M) | Redis **0.46–0.50 ms** against 0.72 and 1.36 ms | At its defaults Redis finds 74–75% of the true top 10; Chronos 98.6–99.98% |
| Bulk vector load vs LanceDB | Chronos 4.7 s (76k), 64 s (1M) vs LanceDB **1.0 s, 12 s** | LanceDB takes an in-process Arrow table; Chronos gets rows over the Postgres protocol |
| Server memory at 1M vectors | Chronos 7.7 GB after, 14.4 GB peak; Milvus 5.2 GB, Qdrant 6.6 GB | 6 GB of raw vectors; not investigated yet |

## Correctness and testing

| Check | What it does | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Test suite** | 71 integration suites + unit and doc tests, run in CI on Linux | **563 passed, 0 failed** (7 ignored) |
| **Crash suite** | Cuts the log at random bytes with torn writes, then recovers (`CRASH_RUNS=10000`) | 10,000 / 10,000 recover exactly what reached disk |
| **Deterministic simulation** | [shuttle](https://github.com/awslabs/shuttle) explores concurrent schedules of agents, writes, checkpoints and GC | Passes 3,000 schedules; failing schedules replay exactly |
| **Jepsen-style** | `kill -9` the server during concurrent fork/merge bank transfers | 300 kills, 108,178 transfers, none lost, every balance matches |
| **Postgres differential** | Same queries on Chronos DB and real Postgres 17, results compared | Functions, types, errors and formatting match |
| **sqllogictest** | SQLite's query corpus (622 files, 5.68M records) over the Postgres protocol, the same runner on Chronos DB and Postgres 17 | Chronos **99.912%**, Postgres 17 99.796%; **no wrong answer Postgres gets right**; 63 fail only on Chronos (division by zero beside a NULL constant). [§13](BENCHMARKS.md#13-correctness-sqlites-sqllogictest-over-the-postgres-protocol) |
| **Capability audit** | 30 end-to-end capability checks, executed | 27 pass, 3 partial (being closed) |

The Jepsen-style test found two real bugs before this release (money created by a merge that treated equal values as no conflict, and a silent loss after a fast restart), and both are fixed. See [BENCHMARKS.md §5](BENCHMARKS.md#5-crash-safety).

## Status and roadmap

Chronos DB is a **working engine**, released as [v0.1.3](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/tag/v0.1.3) on 2026-09-29, and not yet used in production.

- [x] Worlds: fork, diff, three-way merge, partial merges, time travel, undo
- [x] Postgres wire protocol and a broad SQL surface, checked against Postgres 17
- [x] Schemas, `search_path`, `::regclass`, `pg_index` / `pg_constraint` and the `information_schema` constraint views
- [x] PL/pgSQL `EXCEPTION` blocks, `EXECUTE`, `ALTER TYPE` for enums
- [x] Hybrid search: B-tree, BM25, full text, pgvector + HNSW (graded against exact search), PostGIS points
- [x] Agents: MCP, accounts, capabilities, quotas, per-agent limits, safe mode, `SIMULATE` / `REPLAY`
- [x] Durability: WAL, crash suite, shuttle, Jepsen-style kills; S3 storage
- [x] Parallel execution and spill to disk
- [x] Bounded memory for big work: `CREATE INDEX` / `ADD UNIQUE`, one big `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` / `COPY` (atomic), `DISTINCT` aggregates
- [x] Chronos Studio, built in: worlds and the worldline, data grid with in-place editing, import and export, schema diagram, SQL, hybrid and vector search with a map of the vector space, changes and merges, history and checkpoints, simulations, agents, settings
- [x] Fixes from four full code reviews: parser and regex recursion limits, caps on user-controlled sizes, lock poisoning after a panic, Origin and Host checks on the loopback HTTP API, hardened spill files
- [x] First tagged release, [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/tag/v0.1.0): signed binaries for macOS and Linux
- [x] [v0.1.1](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/tag/v0.1.1): merge policies, the sqllogictest correctness run and its fixes, and the fourth review's fixes
- [x] [v0.1.2](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/tag/v0.1.2): `chronos import postgres://`, merge checks, the stale-read check, what a change affects, merging by columns per table, and faster joins and agent writes on many cores
- [x] [v0.1.3](https://github.com/Abhishekxdg/chronosdb/releases/tag/v0.1.3): vector search at 1M 2.1× faster at the same recall, a run's declared scope, `review_columns`, effects only on merge (`NOTIFY ON MERGE`), limits per agent over an hour, and `max_age`
- [x] A plain scan's memory stays flat as tables grow: a `count(*)` or `sum` needs +6 to +8 MB at 1M to 10M rows (it was +63 MB at 10M, and RSS 250 MB is now 107 MB). What still grows is the page directory an open database keeps, about 3 MB per million narrow rows
- [x] Bulk vector ingest: `COPY FROM STDIN (FORMAT binary)` with pgvector's binary vectors, COPY streaming into its INSERT, vectors stored 7 bits to a character. Loading 76k embeddings is now bound by the disk, not the protocol (it decodes them all in 0.7 s); LanceDB's 2 s load doesn't wait for the disk (no fsync)
- [x] Write less per vector load: integer keys are stored in number order (tables made from now on), so a load in id order goes straight into the tree. A binary COPY of 76k embeddings writes 526 MB (it was 1.82 GB) in 8–15 s
- [x] Bulk loads write once: COPY, `INSERT ... SELECT` or a big `INSERT` skip the log. Many small transactions write each row twice (the log, then the tree), as Postgres does: 1.27 GB for the same 76k embeddings (see [Loading and unloading](docs/sql.md#loading-and-unloading-copy))
- [x] Neon branching benchmark: a Neon branch is ready in 2.3–3.7 s (p50) against Chronos's 0.1–0.2 ms fork in the same harness, and 10 to 100 agents write 0.8k–1.1k rows/s against 270k
- [ ] Outside review of the storage code, design partners
